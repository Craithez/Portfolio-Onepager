Portfolio-onepager-JS-CSS


I am trying to make a portfolio onepager, without prior knowledge of css/javascript etc. 

I learned most of the things from w3schools.com and freecodecamp.org.

Constructive comments and help are appreciated.




Things i want to implement:

Navbar :heavy_check_mark:

Imagechanger :heavy_check_mark:

Typewriting effect :heavy_check_mark:

More "working" icons/buttons :x:

Mobile compatibility :x:

Show active section in navbar after clicking it or scrolling to it :x:

More smooth transitions :x:

Banners for known porgramming languages and completed projects :x:
