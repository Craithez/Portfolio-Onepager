Portfolio-onepager-JS-CSS


I am trying to make a portfolio onepager, without prior knowledge of css/javascript etc. 

Most of the code is from w3schools.com and the rest is tutorials knowledge from freecodecamp.org. (I also locked up many bootstrap for designs and the javascript part)

Constructive comments and help are appreciated.
